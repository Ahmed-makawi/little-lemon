## This project uses: 

* Room database
* Api
* Ktor
* Coil
* MVVM
* SharedPreference


### Room Database:
  Room is an Android library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, allowing you to easily work with a SQLite database in your Android app. It provides compile-time verification of SQL queries, convenient annotations to define database entities and relationships, and supports query return types such as LiveData or RxJava.

### Ktor: 
  Ktor is a framework for building asynchronous server-side and client-side applications in Kotlin. It is lightweight, modular, and easy to use. Ktor allows you to create HTTP servers, build RESTful APIs, handle routing, authentication, and more. It embraces Kotlin's coroutines to provide an asynchronous and non-blocking programming model.

### Coil:
  Coil is an image loading library for Android that aims to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. It provides a simple API for loading images from various sources such as network, local storage, or even content providers. Coil is designed to handle image loading asynchronously, cache images intelligently, and provide extensive customization options.

### MVVM:
  MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, which is an architectural pattern used in software development, particularly in building user interfaces. In MVVM, the Model represents the data and business logic, the View represents the UI components, and the ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, exposing data and handling user interactions. MVVM promotes separation of concerns and facilitates testability and maintainability of code.

### SharedPreferences:
  SharedPreferences is an Android API that provides a way to store and retrieve simple data in key-value pairs. It is commonly used for storing application settings, user preferences, or small amounts of data that need to persist across app sessions. SharedPreferences offers a simple interface to read and write data.
